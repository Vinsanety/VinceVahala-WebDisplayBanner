### Constellation Software Interview Coding Challenge, following [const-recruiting-exercises](https://github.com/Constellation-Engineering/const-recruiting-exercises/tree/main/engineering/display).

### Brief Synopsis

I took only a couple hours to work on this as instructed. Had I more time, I am confident I could perfect it. For performance, I chose CSS for most of the animations, except for the scrolling of the text, which I jused vanilla JS.

##### Challenges:

- Continual loop for the animations. With more time I could perfect this.
- Having the animations line up with the correct timing was also a fun challenge.

##### Viewing assessment

- I ran it locally on a simple php server. If needed, I'd be glad to put it in a codepen or serve it live somewhere.
